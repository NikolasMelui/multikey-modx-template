<strong>Fixed date:</strong> 2014-Jul-15<br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong> <br />
A significant vulnerability was discovered in the Manager login of MODX Revolution that also affects the use of the Login Extra. A malicious user could formulate a link that automatically logs the user into their own account, then redirects the user to a site the attacker controls immediately, exposing the user&#039;s CSRF token. This can be exploited with or without getting the user to enter their credentials in the form.<br />

Upgrade to <a href="http://modx.com/download/release/revolution-2.2.15-pl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Revolution 2.2.15</a>.
