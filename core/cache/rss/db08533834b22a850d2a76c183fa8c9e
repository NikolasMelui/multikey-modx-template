<strong>Day 1: Talks</strong><br />
The first day of MODXpo 2017 will be a full day of talks, presented by MODX community members including Greame Leighfield, Vasily Naumkin, Ivan Klimchuk and Gauke Pieter Sietzema.

<strong>Day 2: Workshops</strong><br />
The second day will be packed with workshops. Munich’s MODXpo workshops were well received. We’re sure these will be a hit in Minsk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tickets</strong><br />
The ticket price has been set at 99BYN (see in <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=EUR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EUR</a>, <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=USD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USD</a> and <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=GBP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GPB</a>). You’ll get two days full of MODX goodness, including food throughout the day, a tour through Minsk and of course a goodie-bag. Also, expect most of the community heading to a bar together after each day to relax and enjoy some local drinks.<br />

<strong>Getting to Minsk</strong><br />
A lot of Western European and US citizens haven’t visited Belarus yet and might be hesitant to do so. Our MODX-friends from <a href="https://www.sterc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sterc</a> have traveled the whole continent for MODX Meetups—including Kazakhstan and Belarus. <br />
<br />
Sterc’s Gauke Pieter has this to say about their trip to Belarus: <br />
<br />
<blockquote>“Traveling to Minsk was as easy as traveling to Munich: flying from Amsterdam with a decent airplane, landing on a really neat airport and traveling to our Minsk city center Hotel was a breeze. <br />
    The taxis we used all had WiFi, which was really useful. If you don’t like taxis: there’s a very good subway. The hotel had high standards and beautiful big rooms. The best part: the people from Belarus are very kind and helpful.” <br />

2.5.8 was released today. It contains over 30 fixes—many of which were the fruits of the recent MODX Bug Hunt, held on July, 7th in Munich, Germany with participants from around the world.<br />
<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5.8</strong><br />
You can find all the changes in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.5.8-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a>, but we’ve created a list with highlights for you:<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
<li>Fixed multiple annoyances within the media browser</li>
<li>Fixed user session token if it is set but value is empty, which will prevent unexpectedly logging out </li>
<li>Fixed issue with incorrect signature during installation of two packages with setup options, which prevented some extras from updating</li>
<li>Update xPDO to fix issue with validation rules</li>
<li>Refresh Element in tree after changing name in element’s panel</li>
<li>Refresh the parent (Resource) node when creating the first child</li></ul>

<br />
<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Revolution 2.5.2 contained critical security enhancements, and if you are not yet running 2.5.2 or higher, you should upgrade to 2.5.8 now. See below for more info.</strong><br />
<br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you’re running, log into your website Manager. If the version number doesn’t appear in the top left-hand corner of the Manager, go to <em>Manage&gt;Reports&gt;System Info</em>.<br />
<br />
If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="https://modx.com/support-and-services/services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="services/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>.<br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
<strong>Revolution 2.5.2 contained critical security enhancements, and if you are not yet running 2.5.2 or higher, you should upgrade to 2.5.7 now. See below for more info.</strong><br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you’re running, log into your website Manager. If the version number doesn’t appear in the top left-hand corner of the Manager, go to &lt;em&gt;Manage&gt;Reports&gt;System Info&lt;/em&gt;.<br />
If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="https://modx.com/support-and-services/services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="services/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>.<br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong> <br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Evolution you’re running, login to your website Manager and it should be in the upper right hand corner—possibly left, if extremely old. <br />
<br />

<strong>Important Note for TinyMCE Users</strong> <br />
<br />
We have found an issue with the widely used TinyMCE Extra (the word processor-like toolbar for MODX Resources) where you cannot load Resources after Upgrading. TinyMCE by splittingred is no longer actively maintained and we recommend choosing one of the other <a href="https:/modx.com/extras/browse/?search=Tinymce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE Extras</a> for 2.5.1+. There is a <a href="https:/github.com/modxcms/TinyMCE/pull/20/files" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line patch available</a> if you want to continue using TinyMCE. <br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong><br />
Nearly all releases contain vital security patches. If you are using a version lower than 2.3.6 you should consider an upgrade to 2.5.1 mandatory. <br />
<br />
<strong>Security is an Ongoing Process</strong><br />
We cannot stress how important it is to run the most current version of MODX. We are always improving security. Upgrade regularly to reduce the chance of your site getting hacked. If you need help upgrading your MODX site, <a href="http://modx.com/support-and-services/maintain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">let us know</a>. <br />

Nearly all releases contain vital security patches. If you are using a version lower than 2.3.6 you should consider an upgrade to 2.5.1 mandatory. <br />
<br />
<strong>Security is an Ongoing Process</strong><br />
We cannot stress how important it is to run the most current version of MODX. We are always improving security. Upgrade regularly to reduce the chance of your site getting hacked.

<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
MODX Revolution 2.5 continues the tradition of enhancing functionality and performance for MODX Revolution, augmenting security, and fixing a variety of bugs. The excellent new features include the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>Preparing for the Future</strong><br />
MODX CMS has alway been forward thinking. We adopted PDO for database access years before others even considered it, and you could power HTML5/CSS3 mobile responsive sites with our first release in 2005, even though those technologies didn’t exist at the time. We continue this tradition with a few things that are here today, and that will be huge soon:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>PHP 7 compatibility (it’s coming soon to a server near you). PHP 7 performs significantly faster than any previous release before it so your sites should be able to handle more visitors and serve them more quickly, keeping them engaged and returning for more.</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. The work that is going on for the Accessible Manager theme that takes this much further, works in MODX Revolution 2.5, too.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Improved UX</strong><br />
<img src="https://modx.com/assets/i/blogs/ryan/25-mobile-sim-collage.png" border="0" /><br />
Our quest to improve end-user and developer experiences will never be over. To that point, the following areas received attention for 2.5:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>New default content for new installs provides helpful resources and information. Instead of the empty blank page in all previous versions of MODX Revolution, you now get a nice intro page with some important links to assist and orient new users.</li>
    <li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager. As a stepping stone towards a new Manager in the future, this allows you to make edits and access the Manager much more easily than was possible before thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> intense efforts of JP Devries</a>.</li>
    <li>Add ability to unpack zip files in the file tree / media manager</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Developer Sugar</strong><br />
Sometimes you need to create custom functionality that available MODX Extras do not address. Often this involves creating a Custom Manager Pages and interfaces inside a Component.<br />
<br />
Previously, this required a dive into the “exciting” world of ExtJS, with which most people have a loathe-hate relationship. Now, views for applications you build into the MODX Manager are much easier to create using plain old HTML/CSS and MODX Tags. A special thanks goes to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Faster Performance</strong><br />
Google loves fast sites, as do your visitors. MODX has always been performant when serving cached pages, now it’s even more so:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>Parser optimizations which improve pre-caching performance. This means visitors will be served more quickly, and Google will give your site a little more respect, which it clearly deserves.</li>
    <li>The new <em>anonymous_sessions</em> setting (enabled by default) can significantly speed up the performance for sites that don’t need to have PHP sessions or logged in users. When this setting is disabled, and a page is fully cached, having sessionless anonymous visitors eliminates the need for a database connection for that visitor on each request. If your site serves even moderate traffic, this can significantly reduce the amount of processor required to operate. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Changes in MODX Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
Previously created sites, currently on Revolution 2.3 or above, should work when upgrading to 2.5, but we do suggest testing on an clone of your site, first. Earlier versions may take a bit of extra effort and code updates if they use non-public APIs or directly access the database.<br />
<br />

Speaking of things that don&#039;t happen often, It&#039;s been 15 months since the last release of MODX Evolution. The international community-led team that is behind the current release, have made some important changes since that time including replacing the frameset in the Evo Manager with iFrames, virtually eliminated the document Resource limitations, and the team has worked very hard to make Evo fully compatible with PHP 5.6 through to PHP 7.<br />
<br />
Due to the time since the previous release and the significant number of changes for both security and PHP server compatibility, Evolution 1.1 should be considered mandatory update/upgrade for all users of MODX Evo 1.0.15 and below.<br />
